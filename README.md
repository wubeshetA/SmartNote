# SmartNote - AI Note Taking App

SmartNote is an AI supported note taking app that allows users to take notes from class rooms, youtube videos, and other online courses.
It uses Generative AI to generate notes(summary) from the audio input. It also generate customized questions (with answers also provided) from the notes to help students understand the notes better.

## Structre
This app is being built with Flutter and Dart and will support firebase backend for authentication and storage.

The repository is structured as follows:

 - `lib/`: contains the source code of the app

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative environment for the development of the SmartNote app. By making the respository public, we hope to encourage contributions from the community.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

The problem of note taking is a very common problem that students face. For many students it is not very convenient to take notes while listening to the lecture or taking online courses because they have to pause the video or the lecture to take notes. This causes distractions and students often miss the whole point or process of a certain concept while trying to take the note. This is where SmartNote comes in. SmartNote uses Generative AI to generate notes from the audio input. It also generate customized questions (with answers also provided) from the notes to help students understand the notes better.

SmartNote leverages Generative AI models to generate notes from audio input. It uses a combination of Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing to generate notes from the audio input. Generative AI models are also used to generate questions from the notes. The questions are generated in a way that they are customized to the notes. The answers to the questions are also provided. We use the OpenAI model `gpt-3.5_turbo` to accomplish this.
