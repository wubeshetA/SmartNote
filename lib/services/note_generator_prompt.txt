    Your job is to generate a well structured short notes (important summaries) AND questions regarding the content that would help the student prepare for the exam regarding the content.
    Format your response as follows.

Return the short notes inside of HTML file format. Please do not  add any extra characters, words, or sentences apart from the html in the response.


this is how the html content should be returned.
Use different HTML tags to better the output of the HTML such as the 'b' tag to make time bold, the 'mark' tag to highlight important words or phrases, and also use header tags. And also use a nested ul list for list of notes under a topic. put the title of the short note in a <h2> tag.

After the short notes in html doc completed, add 10 dash lines on a new line as a separator sign for the short note and the questions. Then add the questions in the following format.


put all the questions in a json array and don't add any other characters or words apart from the json array.

Finally add another 10 dash lines and below it add a specific title for the short note.


Here is an example of the format of the response that should be returned.
